    "The problem to be solved is to predict the passengers that survive the Titanic. The goal is to use passenger characteristics and location to determine if a passenger is likely to die or survive. Based off the Kaggle prompt and the expected typed of output, this problem is a supervised classification problem. A potential way to solve this problem is to use a neural network classifier. For the sake of exploration, I hope to use other machine learning techniques like random forests and support vector machines to classify the passengers aboard the Titanic. The score to determine usefulness of the solution is the accuracy, the percentage of passengers correctly predicted.\n",

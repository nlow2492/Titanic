    "The problem to be solved is to predict the passengers that survive the Titanic. The goal is to use passenger characteristics and location to determine if a passenger is likely to die or survive. Based off the Kaggle prompt and the expected typed of output, this problem is a supervised classification problem. A potential way to solve this problem is to use a neural network classifier. \n",
